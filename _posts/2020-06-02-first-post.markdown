I'll be using this blog to write about my coding journey. For those of you who don't know me, I'm a dietitian in Toronto. I had a hobbyist level of enthusiasm for tech since university. In the summer before graduating, I had attended a few Hack McGill events and got connected to someone about WearHacks. I attended later their hardware hackathon as a volunteer photographer. I just loved the energy so much and the fact that you could build an actual product. Aftewards I actually ended up working for them in contacting companies in securing hardware for hackathons. 

I started on Feb 2, 2020 and so far have spent 192 hours coding. I've been keeping track of my hours to help me stay motivated.

I started off learning CS50x, Harvard's introduction to programming course. It was tough and I struggled with a lot of the assignments. Thankfully I had my boyfriend, who is a PhD in computer science help me out.

In that time I have listened to a lot of podcasts (FreeCode Camp, Code Newbie) and watched tons of videos of people on youtube who have made the transition. I read about many stories and everytime I felt demotivated I would read them and feel pushed to continue.

I made a learning plan and had someone review it and got some advice.
